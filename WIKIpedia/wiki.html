    <p >The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally from the 
        Indian subcontinent, and the green peafowl from Southeast Asia. The
         Congo peafowl, native only to the Congo Basin, is not a true peafowl. 
         Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant
          plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which 
           an eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of covert feathers, which they display

          proposed in his handicap principle that these features acted as honest signals 
          of the males' fitness, since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the 
          difficulty of surviving with such large and conspicuous structures.</p>

    <h4 >Description</h4>  
</div>
<div class="fivepara">
    <p>The Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus) has iridescent blue and green plumage,
         mostly metal-like blue and green. In both species, females are a little
          smaller than males in terms of weight and wingspan, but males are significantly 
          longer due to the "tail", also known as a "train".[2] The peacock train consists
           not of tail quill feathers, but highly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers 
           are marked with eyespots, best seen when a peacock fans his tail. All species have
            a crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, brown, and
             green in her plumage. The female also displays her plumage to ward off female 
             competition or signal danger to her young.

    </p>
    <p>
        Male green peafowl (Pavo muticus) have green and bronze or gold plumage, and black wings
         with a sheen of blue. Unlike Indian peafowl, the green peahen is similar to the male, but 
         has shorter upper tail coverts, a more coppery neck, and overall less iridescence. Both
          males and females have spurs.[3]
    </p>
    <p>
        
        The Congo peacock (Afropavo congensis) male does not display his covert feathers, but uses
         his actual tail feathers during courtship displays. These feathers are much shorter than 
         those of the Indian and green species, and the ocelli are much less pronounced. Females of 
         the Indian and African species are dull grey and/or brown. Chicks of both sexes in all the
          species are cryptically coloured. They vary between yellow and tawny, usually with patches 
          of darker brown or light tan and "dirty white" ivory. Mature peahens have been recorded as
           suddenly growing typically male peacock plumage and making male calls.[4] Research has 
           suggested that changes in mature birds are due to a lack of estrogen from old or damaged
            ovaries, and that male plumage and calls are the default unless hormonally suppressed.[5]

</div>

<div class="sixpara">
    <p>
        As with many birds, vibrant iridescent plumage colours are not primarily pigments,
        but structural colouration. Optical interference Bragg reflections, based on regular, 
        periodic nanostructures of the barbules (fiber-like components) of the feathers, produce
         the peacock's colours. 2D photonic-crystal structures within the layers of the barbules
          cause the colouration of their feathers.[6] Slight changes to the spacing of the barbules
           result in different colours. Brown feathers are a mixture of red and blue: one colour is
            created by the periodic structure and the other is created by a Fabry–Pérot interference
             peak from reflections from the outer and inner boundaries. Color derived from physical 
             structure rather than pigment can vary with viewing angle, causing iridescence.[7]

            Most commonly, during a courtship display, the visiting female peahen will stop directly
            in front of the male peacock – thus providing her the ability to assess the male at 90° 
            to the surface of the feather. Then, the male will turn and display his feathers about 45°
             to the right of the sun's azimuth which allows the sunlight to accentuate the iridescence
              of his train. If the female chooses to interact with the male, he will then turn to face 
              her and shiver his train so as to begin the mating process.[8]</p>

            Sexual selection Charles Darwin suggested in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex that 
            peafowl plumage may have evolved through sexual selection: Many female progenitors of the peacock must,
             during a long line of descent, have appreciated this superiority; for they have unconsciously, by the
              continued preference for the most beautiful males, rendered the peacock the most splendid of living birds.
               Aposematism and natural selection It has been suggested that a peacock's train, loud call, and fearless
                behaviour have been formed by natural selection (with or without sexual selection too), and served as an 
                aposematic display to intimidate predators and rivals.[9][10] This hypothesis is designed to explain Takahashi's
                 observations that in Japan, neither reproductive success nor physical condition correlates with the train's 
                 length, symmetry or number of eyespots.[11]</p>

            Most commonly, during a courtship display, the visiting female peahen will stop directly
            in front of the male peacock – thus providing her the ability to assess the male at 90° 
            to the surface of the feather. Then, the male will turn and display his feathers about 45°
             to the right of the sun's azimuth which allows the sunlight to accentuate the iridescence
              of his train. If the female chooses to interact with the male, he will then turn to face 
              her and shiver his train so as to begin the mating process.[8]</p>
